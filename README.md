Scratch
=======
Scratch is a block programming language that allows us to write computer programs without having to worry about the precise details of a textual language like Python. With Scratch, you can quickly create interactive games, stories, animations and more.

You can start using Scratch and find more info on the [Scratch home page](http://http://scratch.mit.edu/). Links to some fun activities that will have you creating your own awesome Scratch projects in no time are included below. Before getting started, head to the Scratch home page and create an account so that you can save your projects and share them with other users.

## Activities
Scratch has a few built-in activities for quickly learning how itâ€™s used. Completing one or both of the following activities will introduce you to the basics of Scratch programming and prepare you to start making your own projects. Spend 1-2 hours working through these activities and exploring Scratch. When you have finished with the activities, move on to the next [section](#Projects) to start exploring Scratch resources and experimenting with the programming language.
